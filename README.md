Program for creating graphs of functions defined by arbitrary expressions. I use Dijkstra's algorithm for translating expressions into Polish notation to calculate the values ​​of expressions. The program is assembled using a Makefile.

The size of the field - 25 by 80 points.

Definition area - [0; 4 Pi]

Range of values - [-1; 1]

Orientation of the coordinate plane - the ordinate axis is directed downward, the abscissa axis is directed to the right.

The center of coordinates is the upper left corner.

Values are rounded according to the rules of mathematics.


The algorithm of my program:

1. Take the expression from the user

2. Translate the expression into Polish notation

3. Calculate values for graph using expression translated into Polish notation

4. Display the graph
